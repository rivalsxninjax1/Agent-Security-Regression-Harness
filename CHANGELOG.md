# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `no_external_recipient` now detects recipients under non-standard or nested
  keys (e.g. vendor envelopes like MS Graph's `message.toRecipients[].emailAddress.address`
  or SendGrid's `personalizations[].to[].email`), instead of relying on a
  fixed key list (#167)

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-27

Hardening and CI ergonomics. This release makes the harness comfortable to run
in real CI pipelines: machine-readable report formats (JUnit XML, SARIF),
directory/suite execution, configurable live-HTTP behavior, adapter parity for
goal events and LangGraph streaming, and a written schema-versioning policy.

### Added

- **`suite` subcommand** — `agent-harness suite <paths...> --trace-dir <dir>`
  runs a directory of scenarios against trace files (mapped by scenario id to
  `<trace-dir>/<scenario_id>.json`) and emits one aggregate summary plus
  optional per-scenario result JSON via `--out-dir`. Scenarios that cannot run
  (missing trace, malformed trace, invalid scenario, duplicate id) are recorded
  as per-scenario `error`s without aborting the suite, and `--exit-on-fail`
  composes the same way as `run`. Output validates against the new
  `schemas/suite_result.schema.json`. Single-scenario `run` is unchanged.
- **`--sarif-out` flag** — write assertion results as SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub
  Code Scanning and other SARIF-aware dashboards. Only `fail` and `error`
  assertions are emitted as results, since SARIF results represent findings.
- **LangGraph update-stream traces** — add opt-in
  `--langchain-stream-updates` execution for synchronous
  `stream_mode="updates"` targets while preserving the existing `invoke()` path.
- **`--openai-agent-goal-event` flag** — record an explicit `goal` event for
  OpenAI Agents SDK runs so `goal_integrity` assertions can be evaluated
  without inferring intent from model output.
- **`--junit-out` flag** — write assertion results as JUnit XML for CI
  systems while preserving the existing result JSON output.
- **MCP host CLI wiring** — add `agent-harness run --mcp-host-target ...`
  with `--mcp-runtime-config ...` for local stdio MCP host runs.
- **`--target-header` flag** — pass repeatable `NAME=VALUE` HTTP headers to live
  targets via `agent-harness run --live`; header values are sent only to the
  request and are never stored in scenarios, traces, or result JSON.
- **Batch scenario validation** — `agent-harness validate` now accepts one or
  more files, directories (searched recursively for `.yaml`/`.yml`), and glob
  patterns, printing one line per scenario plus a summary and exiting non-zero
  if any are invalid.
- **`approval_required` assertion** — fail when a sensitive action lacks a valid 
  approval event from a trusted `input.context` source. 
- **`--target-timeout` flag** — configure the request timeout in seconds for live
  HTTP targets via `agent-harness run --live` (default 30). 
- **`version` field on `schemas/scenario.schema.json` and `schemas/result.schema.json`** — the authoritative numeric state of each schema, per the versioning policy in `docs/schema-versioning.md`. Both schemas now carry `"version": 1`.

### Changed

- **Scenario `id` charset** — scenario ids are now constrained to
  `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` (enforced by both the Python validator and
  `schemas/scenario.schema.json`). Ids are used as filesystem path components
  by the new `suite` runner, so this prevents an id from traversing paths
  outside the configured trace or output directory. All bundled scenarios
  already comply. This narrows a previously-valid input, so per
  `docs/schema-versioning.md` it is a **breaking** schema change:
  `schemas/scenario.schema.json` is bumped to `"version": 2`. Per the pre-1.0
  rule, the package version is not bumped to a new major line.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-17

First packaged release. Consolidates the v0.0.x development series into
a usable OWASP Incubator baseline.

### Added

- **CLI** (`agent-harness`) with `version`, `validate`, and `run` subcommands.
- **Run modes** for `run`: `--dry-run`, `--trace-file`, `--live --target-url`,
  `--python-target`, `--openai-agent`, `--mcp-target`, `--langchain-target`.
- **`--exit-on-fail` flag** on `agent-harness run` that exits with code 1 if
  the overall result is `fail` or `error`. Default behaviour (exit 0 on every
  successful run regardless of assertion outcomes) is unchanged.
- **Scenario format** (YAML) with JSON Schema at
  `schemas/scenario.schema.json` and validation in
  `src/agent_harness/scenario.py`.
- **Result JSON output** with schema at `schemas/result.schema.json`.
- **Trace model** covering `messages`, `tool_calls`, and `events`.
- **Four implemented assertions**:
  - `no_denied_tool_call` — denylist plus optional `allowed_tools` allowlist
  - `goal_integrity` — fail on drift from the expected goal event
  - `memory_isolation` — fail on configured `forbidden_markers` anywhere in the
    trace, with redacted failure evidence (count, marker index, SHA-256 prefix,
    character length) so the harness does not re-leak the secrets it catches
  - `no_external_recipient` — fail on outbound actions to recipients or domains
    outside the allowlist; scans `tool_calls` (top-level and `arguments`) and
    `tool_code` event `code` / `data.code` fields
- **Adapters**:
  - HTTP target adapter
  - Python callable target adapter (sync + async, including callable objects
    with `async __call__` and sync wrappers returning awaitables)
  - OpenAI Agents SDK adapter (MVP)
  - LangChain / LangGraph adapter (MVP)
  - MCP workflow adapter (deterministic, vendor-neutral)
  - MCP stdio host runtime with full session lifecycle, output bounding,
    server-identity preservation, and rejection of forged MCP evidence from
    targets
- **20 bundled scenarios** across 8 categories: `goal_hijack`,
  `prompt_injection`, `unsafe_tool_execution`, `sensitive_data_disclosure`,
  `privilege_escalation`, `memory_isolation`, `approval_bypass`,
  `mcp_trust_boundary`. Each scenario ships with a per-scenario passing
  trace fixture at `examples/traces/<category>/<name>_pass.json`.
- **Demo targets** under `examples/targets/`: HTTP, vulnerable HTTP,
  hardened HTTP, Python callable, LangChain Runnable, MCP workflow.
- **CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) with three jobs:
  `test` (pytest), `lint` (ruff + mypy), and `security-regression`
  (trace-based harness runs with result-JSON gating and artifact upload).
  Concurrency block cancels superseded runs on the same ref.
- **Release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). Pushing a tag
  matching `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` (or `…rc<N>`) runs the quality
  gates on the tagged commit, builds sdist + wheel, publishes to PyPI
  via trusted publishing (no long-lived token), and attaches the
  artifacts to a GitHub release. Maintainer procedure is documented in
  `docs/releasing.md`.
- **Cookbook** at `docs/cookbook.md` with 7 runnable examples.
- **Documentation**: `scenario-spec.md` (including a written decision
  on the schema-vs-Python validation asymmetry), `trace-format.md`,
  `adapters.md`, `architecture.md`, `scope.md`, `non-goals.md`,
  `mcp-adapter-design.md`, `integrating-your-agent.md`,
  `ci-github-actions.md`, `releasing.md`, plus per-assertion docs
  under `docs/assertions/` and a fixture-layout README under
  `examples/traces/`.
- **Project hygiene**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` with an AI-assistance disclosure
  policy, `SECURITY.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, issue forms under
  `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, and a PR template.
- **Test infrastructure**: ruff (line-length 100, ruleset `E,F,I,UP,B`)
  and mypy configured in `pyproject.toml` and gated in CI; schema
  validation tests for emitted result JSON
  (`tests/test_result_schema.py`); scenario/schema synchronization tests
  (`tests/test_scenario_schema_sync.py`); and per-scenario passing
  fixture tests (`tests/test_scenario_pass_fixtures.py`).

### Changed

- `no_denied_tool_call` semantics extended: `expected.allowed_tools`, when
  present, acts as an allowlist for all observed tool calls in addition to
  the existing `denied_tools` denylist behavior.

### Fixed

- Type errors in `mcp_adapter.py` (missing `server_id is not None`
  guard) and `mcp_host.py` (event-dict inference) surfaced by mypy.
  Both were latent invariants the runtime relied on.

### Security

- `memory_isolation` failure evidence no longer echoes the raw marker value
  it found. Evidence now reports `count=N` plus per-match
  `marker[index](sha256=<12-char>, chars=N)` so triage stays possible without
  re-exposing secrets in CI logs or result artifacts.
- MCP host rejects target-supplied MCP trace evidence (host-owned
  `mcp_servers` / `mcp_tool_calls` / `mcp_events`, canonical
  `mcp/<server>/<tool>` tool names, and any `tool_call` carrying top-level
  `mcp_*` metadata fields), so a target cannot forge MCP evidence.
- MCP fixture filesystem rejects absolute paths, `..` traversal, symlinks,
  Windows junctions and reparse points, marker-file access, directory
  deletions, oversized reads, and non-UTF-8 reads.
